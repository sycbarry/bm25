5 || 1 || berkshire hathaway inc
5 || 2 || to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway inc charlie munger my long-time partner and i have the job of managing the savings of a great number of individuals
5 || 3 || we are grateful for their enduring trust a relationship that often spans much of their adult lifetime
5 || 4 || it is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as i write this letter
5 || 5 || a common belief is that people choose to save when young expecting thereby to maintain their living standards after retirement
5 || 6 || any assets that remain at death this theory says will usually be left to their families or possibly to friends and philanthropy
5 || 7 || our experience has differed
5 || 8 || we believe berkshires individual holders largely to be of the once-a-saver always-a-saver variety
5 || 9 || though these people live well they eventually dispense most of their funds to philanthropic organizations
5 || 10 || these in turn redistribute the funds by expenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the original benefactor
5 || 11 || sometimes the results have been spectacular
5 || 12 || the disposition of money unmasks humans
5 || 13 || charlie and i watch with pleasure the vast flow of berkshire-generated funds to public needs and alongside the infrequency with which our shareholders opt for look-at-me assets and dynasty-building
5 || 14 || who wouldnt enjoy working for shareholders like ours what we do charlie and i allocate your savings at berkshire between two related forms of ownership
5 || 15 || first we invest in businesses that we control usually buying  of each
5 || 16 || berkshire directs capital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the ceos who make day-by-day operating decisions
5 || 17 || when large enterprises are being managed both trust and rules are essential
5 || 18 || berkshire emphasizes the former to an unusual  some would say extreme  degree
5 || 19 || disappointments are inevitable
5 || 20 || we are understanding about business mistakes our tolerance for personal misconduct is zero
5 || 21 || in our second category of ownership we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we passively own pieces of businesses
5 || 22 || holding these investments we have no say in management
6 || 1 || our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers
6 || 2 || please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales
6 || 3 || that point is crucial charlie and i are not stock-pickers we are business-pickers
6 || 4 || over the years i have made many mistakes
6 || 5 || consequently our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics many that enjoy very good economic characteristics and a large group that are marginal
6 || 6 || along the way other businesses in which i have invested have died their products unwanted by the public
6 || 7 || capitalism has two sides the system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services
6 || 8 || schumpeter called this phenomenon creative destruction one advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that  episodically  it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices
6 || 9 || its crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices both high and low
6 || 10 || efficient markets exist only in textbooks
6 || 11 || in truth marketable stocks and bonds are baffling their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect
6 || 12 || controlled businesses are a different breed
6 || 13 || they sometimes command ridiculously higher prices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations
6 || 14 || unless under duress the owner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation
6 || 15 ||             at this point a report card from me is appropriate in  years of berkshire management most of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so
6 || 16 || in some cases also bad moves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck
6 || 17 || remember our escapes from near-disasters at usair and salomon i certainly do our satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions  that would be about one every five years  and a sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term investors such as berkshire
6 || 18 || lets take a peek behind the curtain
6 || 19 || the secret sauce in august   yes   berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the  million shares of coca-cola we now own
6 || 20 || the total cost was  billion  then a very meaningful sum at berkshire
6 || 21 || the cash dividend we received from coke in  was  million
6 || 22 || by  the dividend had increased to  million
6 || 23 || growth occurred every year just as certain as birthdays
6 || 24 || all charlie and i were required to do was cash cokes quarterly dividend checks
6 || 25 || we expect that those checks are highly likely to grow
7 || 1 || american express is much the same story
7 || 2 || berkshires purchases of amex were essentially completed in  and coincidentally also cost billion
7 || 3 || annual dividends received from this investment have grown from  million to  million
7 || 4 || those checks too seem highly likely toincrease
7 || 5 || these dividend gains though pleasing are far from spectacular
7 || 6 || but they bring with them important gains in stock prices
7 || 7 || at yearend our coke investment was valued at  billion while amex was recorded at  billion
7 || 8 || each holding now accounts for roughly  of berkshires net worth akin to its weighting long ago
7 || 9 || assume for a moment i had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the s one that flat-lined and simply retained its  billion value in 
7 || 10 || an example would be a high-grade -year bond that disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant  of berkshires net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged  million or so of annual income
7 || 11 || the lesson for investors the weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom
7 || 12 || over time it takes just a few winners to work wonders
7 || 13 || and yes it helps to start early and live into your s as well
7 || 14 || the past year in brief berkshire had a good year in 
7 || 15 || the companys operating earnings  our term for income calculated using generally accepted accounting principles gaap exclusive of capital gains or losses from equity holdings  set a record at  billion
7 || 16 || charlie and i focus on this operational figure and urge you to do so as well
7 || 17 || the gaap figure absent our adjustment fluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date
7 || 18 || note its acrobatic behavior in  which is in no way unusual earnings in  billions gaap earnings we  quarter operating earnings are required to report             the gaap earnings are  misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually
7 || 19 || capital gains to be sure have been hugely important to berkshire over past decades and we expect them to be meaningfully positive in future decades
7 || 20 || but their quarter-by-quarter gyrations regularly and mindlessly headlined by media totally misinform investors
8 || 1 || a second positive development for berkshire last year was our purchase of alleghany corporation a property-casualty insurer captained by joe brandon
8 || 2 || ive worked with joe in the past and he understands both berkshire and insurance
8 || 3 || alleghany delivers special value to us because berkshires unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to follow valuable andenduringinvestment strategies unavailable to virtuallyallcompetitors
8 || 4 || aided by alleghany our insurance float increased during  from  billion to  billion
8 || 5 || with disciplined underwriting these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over time
8 || 6 || since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in  berkshires float has increased -fold through acquisitions operations and innovations
8 || 7 || though not recognized in our financial statements this float has been an extraordinary asset for berkshire
8 || 8 || new shareholders can get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float on page a-
8 || 9 ||             a very minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in  through berkshire share repurchases as well as similar moves at apple and american express both significant investees of ours
8 || 10 || at berkshire we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses by repurchasing  of the companys outstanding shares
8 || 11 || at apple and amex repurchases increased berkshires ownership a bit without any cost to us
8 || 12 || the math isnt complicated when the share count goes down your interest in our many businesses goes up
8 || 13 || every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices
8 || 14 || just as surely when a company overpays for repurchases the continuing shareholders lose
8 || 15 || at such times gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly but expensive investment banker who recommended the foolish purchases
8 || 16 || gains from value-accretive repurchases it should be emphasized benefit all owners  in every respect
8 || 17 || imagine if you will three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership one of whom manages the business
8 || 18 || imagine further that one of the passive owners wishes to sell his interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders
8 || 19 || when completed has this transaction harmed anyone is the manager somehow favored over the continuing passive owners has the public been hurt when you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country or particularly beneficial to ceos you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue characters that are not mutually exclusive
9 || 1 || almost endless details of berkshires  operations are laid out on pages k-  k-
9 || 2 || charlie and i along with many berkshire shareholders enjoy poring over the many facts and figures laid out in that section
9 || 3 || these pages are not however required reading
9 || 4 || there are many berkshire centimillionaires and yes billionaires who have never studied our financial figures
9 || 5 || theysimplyknow thatcharlie andi alongwithourfamilies andclosefriends  continue tohave verysignificant investments in berkshire and they trust us to treat their moneyas wedo our own
9 || 6 || and that is apromise we can make
9 || 7 ||             finally an important warning even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulatedbymanagers who wishtodo sosuchtamperingis oftenthought ofas sophisticated by ceos directors and their advisors
9 || 8 || reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well
9 || 9 || beatingexpectationsisheraldedas a managerialtriumph
9 || 10 || that activity is disgusting
9 || 11 || it requires no talent to manipulate numbers only a deep desire to deceive is required
9 || 12 || bold imaginative accounting as a ceo once described his deception to me has become one of the shames of capitalism
9 || 13 ||  years  and a few figures in  berkshire was a one-trick pony the owner of a venerable  but doomed  new england textile operation
9 || 14 || with that business on a death march berkshire needed an immediate fresh start
9 || 15 || looking back i was slow to recognize the severity of its problems
9 || 16 || and then came a stroke of good luck national indemnity became available in  and we shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations
9 || 17 || thus began our journey to  a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous savings by our owners that is by their retaining earnings the power of compounding our avoidance of major mistakes and  most important of all  the american tailwind
9 || 18 || america would have done fine without berkshire
9 || 19 || the reverse is not true
9 || 20 || berkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified businesses
9 || 21 || lets first look at the  or so publicly-held companies that trade daily on nasdaq the nyse and related venues
9 || 22 || within this group is housed the members of the sp  index an elite collection of large and well-known american companies
9 || 23 || in aggregate the  earned  trillion in 
9 || 24 || i dont yet have the final results for 
9 || 25 || using therefore the  figures only  of the  including berkshire itself earned  billion or more
9 || 26 || indeed  lost money
10 || 1 || at yearend  berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants american express bank of america chevron coca-cola hp inc moodys occidental petroleum and paramount global
10 || 2 || in addition to those eight investees berkshire owns  of bnsf and  of bh energy each with earnings that exceed the  billion mark noted above  billion at bnsf and  billion at bhe
10 || 3 || were these companies publicly-owned they would replace two present members of the 
10 || 4 || all told our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave berkshire more broadly aligned with the countrys economic future than is the case at any other us
10 || 5 || company
10 || 6 || this calculation leaves aside fiduciary operations such as pension funds and investment companies in addition berkshires insurance operation though conducted through many individually-managed subsidiaries has a value comparable to bnsf or bhe
10 || 7 || as for the future berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and us
10 || 8 || treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses
10 || 9 || we will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses
10 || 10 || our ceo will always be the chief risk officer  a task it is irresponsible to delegate
10 || 11 || additionally our future ceos will have a significant part of their net worth in berkshire shares bought with their own money
10 || 12 || and yes our shareholders will continue to save and prosper by retaining earnings
10 || 13 || at berkshire there will be no finish line
10 || 14 || some surprising facts about federal taxes during the decade ending in  the united states treasury received about  trillion in taxes while it spent  trillion
10 || 15 || though economists politicians and many of the public have opinions about the consequences of that huge imbalance charlie and i plead ignorance and firmly believe that near-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless
10 || 16 || our job is to manage berkshires operations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that will preserve the companys unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwide recessions occur
10 || 17 || berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation but this attribute is far from perfect
10 || 18 || huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences
10 || 19 || the  trillion of revenue was garnered by the treasury through individual income taxes     corporate income tax payments    and a  social security and related receipts  wide variety of lesser levies
10 || 20 || berkshires contribution via the corporate income tax was  billion during the decade almost exactly a tenth of  of all money that the treasury collected
11 || 1 || and that means  brace yourself  had there been roughly  taxpayers in the us
11 || 2 || matching berkshires payments no other businesses nor any of the countrys  million households would have needed to pay any taxes to the federal government
11 || 3 || not a dime
11 || 4 ||             millions billions trillions  we all know the words but the sums involved are almost impossible to comprehend
11 || 5 || lets put physical dimensions to the numbers  if you convert  million into newly-printed  bills you will have a stack that reaches your chest
11 || 6 ||  perform the same exercise with  billion  this is getting exciting  and the stack reaches   of a mile into the sky
11 || 7 || about  finally imagine piling up  billion the total of berkshires - federal income tax payments
11 || 8 || now the stack grows to more than  miles in height about three times the level at which commercial airplanes usually cruise
11 || 9 || when it comes to federal taxes individuals who own berkshire can unequivocally state i gave at the office             at berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade
11 || 10 || we owe the country no less americas dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success berkshire has achieved  a contribution berkshire will always need
11 || 11 || we count on the american tailwind and though it has been becalmed from time to time its propelling force has always returned
11 || 12 || i have been investing for  years  more than one-third of our countrys lifetime
11 || 13 || despite our citizens penchant  almost enthusiasm  for self-criticism and self-doubt i have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against america
11 || 14 || and i doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future
11 || 15 || nothing beats having a great partner charlie and i think pretty much alike
11 || 16 || but what it takes me a page to explain he sums up in a sentence
11 || 17 || his version moreover is always more clearly reasoned and also more artfully  some might add bluntly  stated
11 || 18 || here are a few of his thoughts many lifted from a very recent podcast  the world is full of foolish gamblers and they will not do as well as the patient investor
11 || 19 ||  if you dont see the world the way it is its like judging something through a distorted lens
11 || 20 ||  all i want to know is where im going to die so ill never go there
11 || 21 || and a related thought early on write your desired obituary  and then behave accordingly
11 || 22 ||  if you dont care whether you are rational or not you wont work on it
11 || 23 || then you will stay irrational and get lousy results
12 || 1 ||  patience can be learned
12 || 2 || having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one thing for a long time is a huge advantage
12 || 3 ||  you can learn a lot from dead people
12 || 4 || read of the deceased you admire and detest
12 || 5 ||  dont bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy
12 || 6 ||  a great company keeps working after you are not a mediocre company wont do that
12 || 7 ||  warren and i dont focus on the froth of the market
12 || 8 || we seek out good long-term investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time
12 || 9 ||  ben graham said day to day the stock market is a voting machine in the long term its a weighing machine if you keep making something more valuable then some wise person is going to notice it and start buying
12 || 10 ||  there is no such thing as a  sure thing when investing
12 || 11 || thus the use of leverage is dangerous
12 || 12 || a string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero
12 || 13 || dont count on getting rich twice
12 || 14 ||  you dont however need to own a lot of things in order to get rich
12 || 15 ||  you have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor
12 || 16 || when the world changes you must change
12 || 17 ||  warren and i hated railroad stocks for decades but the world changed and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the american economy
12 || 18 || we were slow to recognize the change but better late than never
12 || 19 ||  finally i will add two short sentences by charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for decades warren think more about it
12 || 20 || youre smart and im right and so it goes
12 || 21 || i never have a phone call with charlie without learning something
12 || 22 || and while he makes me think he also makes me laugh
12 || 23 ||             i will add to charlies list a rule of my own find a very smart high-grade partner  preferably slightly older than you  and then listen very carefully to what he says
12 || 24 || a family gathering in omaha charlie and i are shameless
12 || 25 || last year at our first shareholder get-together in three years we greeted you with our usual commercial hustle
12 || 26 || from the opening bell we went straight for your wallet
12 || 27 || in short order our sees kiosk sold you eleven tons of nourishing peanut brittle and chocolates
12 || 28 || in our pt
12 || 29 || barnum pitch we promised you longevity
12 || 30 || after all what else but candy from sees could account for charlie and me making it to  and  i know you cant wait to hear the specifics of last years hustle
12 || 31 || on friday the doors were open from noon until  pm and our candy counters rang up  individual sales
12 || 32 || on saturday sees registered an additional  transactions between     of the    operating hours occurred while our movie  am
12 || 33 || and  pm despite the fact that  and the question-and-answer session were limiting commercial traffic
13 || 1 || do the math sees rang up about  sales per minute during its prime operating time racking up  of volume during the two days with all the goods purchased at a single location selling products that havent been materially altered in  years
13 || 2 || what worked for sees in the days of henry fords model t works now
13 || 3 ||             charlie i and the entire berkshire bunch look forward to seeing you in omaha on may -

41 || 3 || the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face
41 || 4 || additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations
41 || 5 || general business risks terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses
41 || 6 || a cyber biological nuclear or chemical terrorist attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations
41 || 7 || our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems
41 || 8 || we share the risk with all businesses
41 || 9 || cyber security risks we rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business
41 || 10 || like those of many large businesses certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access phishing efforts denial-of- service attacks and other cyber-attacks
41 || 11 || we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent
41 || 12 || a significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions safety failures security events regulatory compliance failures an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties
41 || 13 || attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage
41 || 14 || although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks including business continuity planning disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity
41 || 15 || additionally if we are unable to acquire develop implement adopt or protect rights around new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity
41 || 16 || cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information
41 || 17 || political economic social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions lost revenues higher commodity prices disruption in fuel supplies lower energy consumption unstable markets increased security repair or other costs or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time
41 || 18 || any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results
41 || 19 || furthermore instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital
41 || 20 || we share these risks with all businesses
41 || 21 || we are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions
41 || 22 || major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by warren e
41 || 23 || buffett chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer age  in consultation with charles t
41 || 24 || munger vice chairman of the board of directors age 
41 || 25 || in  berkshires board of directors appointed mr
41 || 26 || gregory abel as vice chairman of berkshires non-insurance operations and mr

41 || 28 || mr
41 || 29 || abel and mr
41 || 30 || jain each report directly to mr
41 || 31 || buffett
41 || 32 || mr
41 || 33 || buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions
41 || 34 || if for any reason the services of our key personnel particularly mr
41 || 35 || buffett were to become unavailable there could be a material adverse effect on our operations
41 || 36 || should a replacement for mr
41 || 37 || buffett be needed currently berkshires board of directors has agreed that mr
41 || 38 || abel should replace mr
41 || 39 || buffett
41 || 40 || the board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for mr
41 || 41 || buffett in the future
41 || 42 || we believe that the boards succession plan together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk
41 || 43 || we need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses
41 || 44 || in our decentralized business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments
41 || 45 || our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel to execute business plans and serve their customers suppliers and other stakeholders
41 || 46 || our inability to recruit train and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and berkshire as a whole
41 || 47 || k-
42 || 1 || investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value
42 || 2 || we concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of issuers
42 || 3 || a significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders equity and our consolidated earnings
42 || 4 || since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries
42 || 5 || our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims- paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits
42 || 6 || competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings
42 || 7 || each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate
42 || 8 || while we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages many factors including technological changes may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages
42 || 9 || accordingly our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages
42 || 10 || if our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts our periodic operating results in the future may decline
42 || 11 || unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost
42 || 12 || our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate
42 || 13 || significant deteriorations of economic conditions including significant inflation over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations
42 || 14 || in addition our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates
42 || 15 || to the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases these operations could be adversely affected
42 || 16 || epidemics pandemics or other similar outbreaks could hurt our operating businesses
42 || 17 || the outbreak of epidemics pandemics or other similar outbreaks in the future may adversely affect our operations including the value of our equity securities portfolio
42 || 18 || this may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities disruption to supply chains and workforce reduction of demand for our products and services credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us and volatility in global equity securities markets among other factors
42 || 19 || we share most of these risks with all businesses
42 || 20 || regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results
42 || 21 || over time in response to financial markets crises global economic recessions and social and environmental issues regulatory initiatives were adopted in the united states and elsewhere
42 || 22 || such initiatives addressed for example the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions the regulation of products and environmental and global-warming matters
42 || 23 || these initiatives impact all of our businesses albeit in varying ways
42 || 24 || increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant but not controlling economic interests
42 || 25 || we cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations andor cash flows
42 || 26 || data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the us
42 || 27 || and throughout the world
42 || 28 || these regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems networks and facilities
42 || 29 || failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties
42 || 30 || climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions may impact our businesses
42 || 31 || the impacts of climate change and the regulation of ghg emissions could impact our businesses to varying degrees
42 || 32 || climate change could cause or intensify hurricanes floods wildfires and other extreme weather events that may increase physical risks to and impacts on our operations
42 || 33 || an increase in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events and storms could impact the physical assets of our non-insurance operations and could produce losses affecting our businesses
42 || 34 || similarly extreme weather events may produce losses affecting our insurance operations as their primary business is to monitor assess and price risk including climate-related risk at an expected economic profit to address the risk-transfer needs of their insurance customers
42 || 35 || additional ghg policies including legislation may emerge that accelerate the transition to a lower ghg emitting economy and could in turn increase costs for our businesses to comply with those policies including bnsf and bhe which combined represent more than  of berkshires direct emissions
42 || 36 || the failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretation of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results
42 || 37 || k-
43 || 1 || risks unique to our regulated businesses our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses
43 || 2 || when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed
43 || 3 || accordingly we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks
43 || 4 || we employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate in excess of  billion
43 || 5 || however despite our efforts it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address
43 || 6 || various provisions of our policies negotiated to limit our risk such as limitations or exclusions from coverage may not be enforceable in the manner we intend as it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations
43 || 7 || our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period
43 || 8 || the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims
43 || 9 || in writing property and casualty insurance policies we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future
43 || 10 || however it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled
43 || 11 || although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date
43 || 12 || estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise
43 || 13 || it is possible that significant claims may emerge or develop in the future from the policies we have written in the past
43 || 14 || as industry practices and legal social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge including new or expanded theories of liability
43 || 15 || these or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent
43 || 16 || in some instances these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes
43 || 17 || as a result the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued
43 || 18 || our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large  billion at december   and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings
43 || 19 || changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital
43 || 20 || our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate
43 || 21 || such regulations may relate to among other things the types of business that can be written the rates that can be charged for coverage the level of capital that must be maintained and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made
43 || 22 || regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to berkshire by these businesses
43 || 23 || us
43 || 24 || state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups including regulations concerning group capital liquidity governance and risk management
43 || 25 || accordingly changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital
43 || 26 || our railroad business conducted through bnsf is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices taxes railroad operations and a variety of health safety labor environmental and other matters
43 || 27 || failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on bnsfs business
43 || 28 || governments may change the legislative andor regulatory framework within which bnsf operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business
43 || 29 || complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures
43 || 30 || bnsf derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities particularly coal
43 || 31 || to the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels such as natural gas or displace coal on a competitive basis revenues and earnings could be adversely affected
43 || 32 || as a common carrier bnsf is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials
43 || 33 || a release of hazardous materials could expose bnsf to significant claims losses penalties and environmental remediation obligations
43 || 34 || changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact bnsfs ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity
43 || 35 || k-
44 || 1 || our utilities and energy businesses operated under bhe are highly regulated by numerous federal state local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate
44 || 2 || these laws and regulations are complex dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change
44 || 3 || regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses
44 || 4 || regulations broadly apply and may limit managements ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including acquiring businesses constructing acquiring disposing or retiring of operating assets operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements setting rates charged to customers establishing capital structures and issuing debt managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates and paying dividends or similar distributions
44 || 5 || failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations such as those relating to air quality climate change emissions performance standards water quality coal ash disposal and other environmental matters or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results
44 || 6 || our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis

74 || 32 || critical accounting policies certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements
74 || 33 || such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty
74 || 34 || accordingly certain amounts currently recorded in our consolidated financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances
74 || 35 || a discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of december   follows
74 || 36 || k-
75 || 1 || managements discussion and analysis continued property and casualty insurance unpaid losses we record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses also referred to as gross unpaid losses or claim liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date
75 || 2 || the timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon among other things the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process
75 || 3 || we use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities which may require significant judgments and assumptions
75 || 4 || as of the balance sheet date recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not- reported ibnr claims
75 || 5 || the period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the claim-tail property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails absent litigation
75 || 6 || casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails occasionally extending for decades
75 || 7 || casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations
75 || 8 || the legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails
75 || 9 || our consolidated claim liabilities including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts as of december   were approximately  billion of which  related to geico and the berkshire hathaway reinsurance group
75 || 10 || additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows
75 || 11 || geico geico predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance
75 || 12 || as of december   geicos gross unpaid losses were  billion and claim liabilities net of reinsurance recoverable were  billion
75 || 13 || geicos claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims
75 || 14 || the key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts frequency and average loss per claim severity
75 || 15 || we utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods including bornhuetter-ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies
75 || 16 || claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages such as bodily injury bi uninsured motorists and personal injury protection are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails so we establish additional case development estimates
75 || 17 || as of december   case development liabilities averaged approximately  of the case reserves
75 || 18 || we select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities
75 || 19 || ibnr claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage
75 || 20 || we use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims
75 || 21 || we estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts producing an ibnr liability estimate
75 || 22 || we may record additional ibnr estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply
75 || 23 || we test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles
75 || 24 || each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost
75 || 25 || our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of  were reduced by  million during  which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings
75 || 26 || the assumptions used to estimate liabilities at december   reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates
75 || 27 || future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated
75 || 28 || with respect to liabilities for bi claims we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at december  
75 || 29 || we estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in bi severities would produce a  million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings
75 || 30 || many of the economic forces that would likely cause bi severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction

76 || 1 || managements discussion and analysis continued property and casualty insurance unpaid losses continued berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrgs liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the nico general re and transre groups

76 || 3 || property casualty total reported case liabilities       ibnr liabilities    gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    reinsurance recoverable    net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses       gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties
76 || 4 || under certain contracts coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently if at all
76 || 5 || in those instances we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates
76 || 6 || in connection with reinsurance contracts the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms
76 || 7 || reinsurance contract terms conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies
76 || 8 || the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative individual risk or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract
76 || 9 || however loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis
76 || 10 || loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses as well as case loss estimates
76 || 11 || ceding companies infrequently provide reliable ibnr loss estimates
76 || 12 || loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers
76 || 13 || in the us client reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from  to  days after the end of the quarterly period while outside of the us reinsurance reporting practices may vary further
76 || 14 || in certain countries clients report annually from  to  days after the end of the annual period
76 || 15 || to the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers further delays in claims reporting may occur
76 || 16 || the relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage contractual reporting terms the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons
76 || 17 || as reinsurers the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms
76 || 18 || we maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms
76 || 19 || generally our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding companys records with respect to the subject business thus providing the ability to audit the reported information
76 || 20 || in the normal course of business disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies
76 || 21 || we resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client
76 || 22 || if disputes cannot be resolved our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes
76 || 23 || we believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition
76 || 24 || establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients
76 || 25 || we generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates
76 || 26 || we independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate we use our own case liability estimate
76 || 27 || for instance as of december   our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately  million for certain legacy workers compensation claims occurring over  years ago
76 || 28 || we also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims which may cause us to adjust our case estimates
76 || 29 || k-
77 || 1 || managements discussion and analysis continued property and casualty insurance unpaid losses continued berkshire hathaway reinsurance group continued although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data loss development patterns industry data and other benchmarks
77 || 2 || the estimate of the ibnr liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix volume claim reporting and handling practices inflation social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts
77 || 3 || the methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories paid and incurred loss development methods  these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns together with expected loss ratios by year
77 || 4 || factors affecting our loss development analysis include but are not limited to changes in the following client claims reporting and settlement practices the frequency of client company claim reviews policy terms and coverage such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses
77 || 5 || collectively these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns
77 || 6 || incurred and paid loss bornhuetter-ferguson methods  these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses
77 || 7 || frequency and severity methods  these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates
77 || 8 || however our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses
77 || 9 || additional analysis  in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and ibnr liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate
77 || 10 || liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of ibnr liabilities required for unreported claims
77 || 11 || anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events
77 || 12 || our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines primarily property exposures utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss bornhuetter-ferguson methods
77 || 13 || certain catastrophe individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequencyhigh severity losses
77 || 14 || our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses
77 || 15 || for our long-tail lines primarily casualty exposures we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications
77 || 16 || in  certain workers compensation claims reported losses were less than expected
77 || 17 || as a result we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years loss events by  million
77 || 18 || we estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately  billion in ibnr liabilities producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings
77 || 19 || we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates
77 || 20 || for other casualty losses other than asbestos environmental and other latent injury claims we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years events by approximately  million in 
77 || 21 || for certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal ibnr liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately  million although outcomes of greater than or less than  million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business
77 || 22 || the change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos environmental and other latent injury claims excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 
77 || 23 || net liabilities for such claims were approximately  billion at december  
77 || 24 || loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge
77 || 25 || k-
78 || 1 || managements discussion and analysis continued property and casualty insurance unpaid losses continued retroactive reinsurance our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates
78 || 2 || claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures
78 || 3 || we expect the claim-tails to be very long
78 || 4 || at december   gross unpaid losses were  billion and deferred charges were  billionour contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and as such we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed  billion
78 || 5 || absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposures we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than  of our estimated gross liability
78 || 6 || we establish liability estimates by individual contract considering exposure and development trends
78 || 7 || in establishing our liability estimates we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios
78 || 8 || we assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined
78 || 9 || we then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses
78 || 10 || we re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed
78 || 11 || certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos environmental and other latent injury claims
78 || 12 || our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately  billion at december  
78 || 13 || we do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies
78 || 14 || when possible we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses
78 || 15 || when detailed loss information is unavailable we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data
78 || 16 || judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated
78 || 17 || legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities
78 || 18 || we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years retroactive reinsurance contracts by  million in 
78 || 19 || in  we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of  billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts
78 || 20 || in connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts we also record deferred charges which at contract inception represents the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received
78 || 21 || we amortize deferred charges which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments
78 || 22 || we adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings
78 || 23 || significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances
78 || 24 || based on the contracts in effect as of december   we estimate that amortization expense in  will approximate  million
78 || 25 || other critical accounting policies our consolidated balance sheet at december   includes goodwill of acquired businesses of  billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of  billion
78 || 26 || we evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment
78 || 27 || goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets
78 || 28 || the key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs
78 || 29 || significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews
78 || 30 || due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time actual results may differ materially from the forecasts
78 || 31 || if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss
78 || 32 || if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit then the excess limited to the carrying amount of goodwill will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss
78 || 33 || k-
79 || 1 || managements discussion and analysis continued other critical accounting policies continued as of december   we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet was not impaired
79 || 2 || the fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the long-term effects of the covid- pandemic on the reporting units businesses as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units which we cannot reliably predict
79 || 3 || consequently any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations
79 || 4 || we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values
79 || 5 || the key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses cash flows and capital expenditures as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs
79 || 6 || a significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests
79 || 7 || in connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 
79 || 8 || the most significant of these reporting units was precision castparts corp
79 || 9 || pcc
79 || 10 || our estimated fair value of pcc was approximately  billion exceeding our carrying value of approximately  billion by

79 || 12 || for the five other reporting units our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately  billion which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately  billion by 
79 || 13 || our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately  billion
79 || 14 || in the second quarter of  we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units and most significantly for pcc
79 || 15 || as a result of our reviews we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of  billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of  million of which approximately  billion related to pcc
79 || 16 || prior to the reevaluation the carrying value of pcc-related goodwill was approximately  billion
79 || 17 || additionally the carrying value of pcc-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately  billion
79 || 18 || substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with berkshires acquisition of pcc in 
79 || 19 || the initial effects of the covid- pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe
79 || 20 || at that time we considered several factors in our reevaluation including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand employment levels and aircraft orders announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production and the actions we were taking to restructure operations
79 || 21 || consequently we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments
79 || 22 || market risk disclosures our consolidated balance sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks

91 || 11 || intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
91 || 12 || certain immaterial balances in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified in prior years to conform to current year presentations
91 || 13 || b use of estimates in preparation of financial statements we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period
91 || 14 || our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs
91 || 15 || in addition estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment
91 || 16 || actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements
91 || 17 || to varying degrees the covid- pandemic and its consequences continues to affect our operating businesses
91 || 18 || significant government and private sector actions have been taken since  to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants
91 || 19 || such actions in  included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world
91 || 20 || in addition significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in  and persisted in

91 || 23 || and elsewhere governments are implementing actions intended to slow price inflation
91 || 24 || the economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
91 || 25 || accordingly significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods

91 || 30 || d investments in fixed maturity securities we classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date
91 || 31 || securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity
91 || 32 || securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings
91 || 33 || all other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value
91 || 34 || substantially all of our investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale

91 || 36 || k-
92 || 1 || notes to consolidated financial statements continued  significant accounting policies and practices continued d investments in fixed maturity securities continued we record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold determined on a specific identification basis
92 || 2 || for securities in an unrealized loss position we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers
92 || 3 || as of the balance sheet date we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors
92 || 4 || we consider the severity of the decline in value creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors
92 || 5 || we record an allowance for credit losses limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows
92 || 6 || the allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances
92 || 7 || the portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income
92 || 8 || e investments in equity securities we carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of investment gains or losses
92 || 9 || f investments under the equity method we utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the operating and financial policies of the investee
92 || 10 || the ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than  of the voting interests of the investee
92 || 11 || this presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted
92 || 12 || we apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-substance common stock as defined by gaap
92 || 13 || in applying the equity method we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee
92 || 14 || we record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment
92 || 15 || if net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee
92 || 16 || such additional equity method losses if any are based upon the change in our claim on the investees book value
92 || 17 || g loans and finance receivables loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans and to a lesser extent commercial loans and site-built home loans
92 || 18 || we carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost net of allowances for expected credit losses based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity
92 || 19 || acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received as well as acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans
92 || 20 || measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection whether the risk is probable or remote
92 || 21 || expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure
92 || 22 || our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing
92 || 23 || expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates collateral recovery rates historical runoff rates interest rates reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure among other factors
92 || 24 || in addition our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts

93 || 2 || we place loans over  days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed
93 || 3 || subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount
93 || 4 || we resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than  days delinquent
93 || 5 || loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started
93 || 6 || once a loan is in the process of foreclosure interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified
93 || 7 || once a modification is complete interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan
93 || 8 || foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold
93 || 9 || loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan

93 || 13 || reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts
93 || 14 || receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances
93 || 15 || we measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience
93 || 16 || in evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral guarantees and other available information
93 || 17 || we charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted
93 || 18 || i derivatives we carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts payable accruals and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets
93 || 19 || balances are net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties
93 || 20 || we record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable
93 || 21 || j fair value measurements as defined under gaap fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists
93 || 22 || adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value
93 || 23 || alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
93 || 24 || market participants are assumed to be independent knowledgeable and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress
93 || 25 || our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities
93 || 26 || considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value
93 || 27 || accordingly estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange

93 || 29 || manufactured inventory costs include materials direct and indirect labor and factory overhead
93 || 30 || at december   we used the last-in-first-out lifo method to value approximately  of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods
93 || 31 || non-lifo inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value

94 || 3 || we record additions to property plant and equipment and equipment held for lease at cost which includes asset additions improvements and betterments
94 || 4 || with respect to constructed assets all materials direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized
94 || 5 || indirect costs include interest over the construction period
94 || 6 || with respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities
94 || 7 || normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred
94 || 8 || depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator
94 || 9 || under group depreciation a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class
94 || 10 || when such assets are retired or sold no gain or loss is recognized
94 || 11 || gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings
94 || 12 || we depreciate property plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives
94 || 13 || ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows buildings and improvements   to  years machinery and equipment   to  years and furniture fixtures and other   to  years
94 || 14 || ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows track structure and other roadway   to  years and locomotives freight cars and other equipment   to  years
94 || 15 || ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows utility generation transmission and distribution systems   to  years interstate natural gas pipeline assets   to  years and independent power plants and other assets   to  years
94 || 16 || we depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from  to  years
94 || 17 || we use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life
94 || 18 || we evaluate property plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale
94 || 19 || upon the occurrence of a triggering event we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value
94 || 20 || if the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value
94 || 21 || m leases we are party to contracts where we lease property from others
94 || 22 || when we lease assets from others we record right- of-use assets and lease liabilities
94 || 23 || right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease
94 || 24 || in this regard lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate
94 || 25 || the lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period
94 || 26 || certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage
94 || 27 || options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised
94 || 28 || generally incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities
94 || 29 || right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment
94 || 30 || as permitted under gaap for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less
94 || 31 || n goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business
94 || 32 || we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually
94 || 33 || when evaluating goodwill for impairment we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit
94 || 34 || several methods may be used to estimate a reporting units fair value including market quotations asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques including but not limited to discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings
94 || 35 || when the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value the excess up to the balance of goodwill is charged to earnings as an impairment loss

95 || 1 || notes to consolidated financial statements continued  significant accounting policies and practices continued n goodwill and other intangible assets continued intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that more-likely-than-not the asset is impaired
95 || 2 || significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests
95 || 3 || we amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives
95 || 4 || intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable
95 || 5 || o revenue recognition we earn insurance premiums on prospective propertycasualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided
95 || 6 || premiums are generally earned in proportion to the coverage provided which in most cases is ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis
95 || 7 || premiums on retroactive propertycasualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception
95 || 8 || premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due
95 || 9 || premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are received in full at the inception of the contracts
95 || 10 || premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers
95 || 11 || premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts
95 || 12 || sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer
95 || 13 || a good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service
95 || 14 || revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers
95 || 15 || we manufacture andor distribute a wide variety of industrial building and consumer products
95 || 16 || our sales contracts provide customers with these products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts
95 || 17 || contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices
95 || 18 || sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations
95 || 19 || in instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service
95 || 20 || sales revenue reflects reductions for returns allowances late delivery penalties volume discounts and other incentives some of which may be contingent on future events
95 || 21 || in certain customer contracts sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities
95 || 22 || sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities
95 || 23 || sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods
95 || 24 || we also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue
95 || 25 || our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance depending on terms of the arrangement
95 || 26 || we recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time primarily from certain castings forgings and aerostructures contracts
95 || 27 || control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured
95 || 28 || these products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract
95 || 29 || the primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination
95 || 30 || the performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer
95 || 31 || the revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped the origin and destination pair and contract incentives which are outlined in various private rate agreements common carrier public tariffs interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes
95 || 32 || the transaction price is generally a per carunit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination
95 || 33 || freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service
95 || 34 || revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date
95 || 35 || invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within  days or less
95 || 36 || customer incentives which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping tofrom specific locations are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments

96 || 1 || notes to consolidated financial statements continued  significant accounting policies and practices continued o revenue recognition continued our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions
96 || 2 || these tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy transmission distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided
96 || 3 || our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business
96 || 4 || energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts
96 || 5 || payments from customers are generally due within  days of billing
96 || 6 || rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations
96 || 7 || when preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued
96 || 8 || other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided
96 || 9 || other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage automotive repair aircraft management aviation training franchising and news distribution
96 || 10 || leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage if applicable under the terms of the contract
96 || 11 || a substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases
96 || 12 || p losses and loss adjustment expenses we record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under propertycasualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date
96 || 13 || such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value
96 || 14 || we base liability estimates on  loss reports from policyholders and cedents  individual case estimates and  estimates of incurred but not reported losses
96 || 15 || losses and loss adjustment expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings include paid claims claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities
96 || 16 || losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts
96 || 17 || reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts
96 || 18 || q retroactive reinsurance contracts we record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with propertycasualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in note p
96 || 19 || with respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts representing the excess if any of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned
96 || 20 || we subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method
96 || 21 || changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances
96 || 22 || we apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances together with periodic amortization are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings
96 || 23 || r insurance policy acquisition costs we capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts subject to ultimate recoverability
96 || 24 || direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts
96 || 25 || we expense all other underwriting costs as incurred
96 || 26 || for short duration contracts we subsequently amortize deferred policy acquisition costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned
96 || 27 || acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized over the expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy
96 || 28 || such anticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits
96 || 29 || the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs generally considers anticipated investment income

97 || 12 || regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods
97 || 13 || regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities

109 || 16 || claim liabilities include average case case development and ibnr estimates
109 || 17 || we establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled
109 || 18 || we establish case loss estimates for liability claims including estimates for loss adjustment expenses as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated
109 || 19 || claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages primarily due to the longer claim-tails the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established
109 || 20 || the claim-tail is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date
109 || 21 || consequently we establish additional case development liabilities which are usually percentages of the case liabilities
109 || 22 || for unreported claims ibnr liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims
109 || 23 || the product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the ibnr liability estimate

129 || 4 || railroad utilities and energy revenues were  billion in   billion in  and  billion in

129 || 7 ||  contingencies and commitments we are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by berkshire subsidiaries
129 || 8 || plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages
129 || 9 || we do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
129 || 10 || berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties
129 || 11 || we currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations
129 || 12 || our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods and services used in their businesses which are not yet reflected in our consolidated financial statements
129 || 13 || the most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad utilities and energy businesses our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain raw materials purchase commitments
129 || 14 || as of december   estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows  billion in   billion in   billion in   billion in   billion in  and  billion after 
129 || 15 || since october  we have owned a  interest in pilot headquartered in knoxville tennessee
129 || 16 || pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in north america primarily under the names pilot or flying j with more than  travel center locations across  us
129 || 17 || states and six canadian provinces
129 || 18 || pilot also has over  retail locations in the us
129 || 19 || and canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers
129 || 20 || through december   we accounted for our investment in pilot under the equity method and the carrying value of our investment was  billion as of december  
129 || 21 || on january   we acquired an additional  interest for approximately  billion
129 || 22 || this amount is based on a contractual agreement that is dependent on pilots earnings for  and its net debt at the end of  and is subject to post- closing adjustments following the completion of pilots independent public accountants audit of its  financial statements
129 || 23 || we obtained control of pilot for financial reporting purposes on january   and consequently we will discontinue the use of the equity method and include pilots financial statements in our consolidated financial statements at that date
129 || 24 || in applying the acquisition method of accounting we are required to remeasure our previously held  interest in pilot to fair value as of january  
129 || 25 || the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method will be recorded as a remeasurement gain
129 || 26 || given the proximity of the acquisition date of the additional pilot interest to the date these consolidated financial statements are issued it was impracticable to provide an initial estimate of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and residual goodwill or proforma information
129 || 27 || we expect to provide such disclosures in our consolidated financial statements beginning with our interim report for the quarterly period ending march  
129 || 28 || we may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders for cash or other assets
129 || 29 || the timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired

138 || 2 || propertycasualty insurance our propertycasualty pc insurance business has been the engine propelling berkshires growth since  the year we acquired national indemnity and its sister company national fire  marine for  million
138 || 3 || today national indemnity is the largest pc company in the world as measured by net worth
138 || 4 || insurance is a business of promises and berkshires ability to honor its commitments is unmatched
138 || 5 || one reason we were attracted to the pc business was the industrys business model pc insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later
138 || 6 || in extreme cases such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos or severe workplace accidents payments can stretch over many decades
138 || 7 || this collect-now pay-later model leaves pc companies holding large sums  money we call float  that will eventually go to others
138 || 8 || meanwhile insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit
138 || 9 || though individual policies and claims come and go the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume
138 || 10 || consequently as our business grows so does our float
138 || 11 || and how it has grown as the following table shows year float in millions                  we may in time experience a decline in float
138 || 12 || if so the decline will be very gradual  at the outside no more than  in any year
138 || 13 || the nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources
138 || 14 || that structure is by design and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies
138 || 15 || that strength will never be compromised
138 || 16 || if our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces
138 || 17 || when such a profit is earned we enjoy the use of free money  and better yet get paid for holding it
138 || 18 || for the pc industry as a whole the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years
138 || 19 || thats because the standard investment strategy for almost all pc companies is heavily  and properly  skewed toward high-grade bonds
138 || 20 || changes in interest rates therefore matter enormously to these companies and during the last decade the bond market has offered pathetically low rates
138 || 21 || consequently insurers suffered as year by year they were forced  by maturities or issuer-call provisions  to recycle their old investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields
138 || 22 || where once these insurers could safely earn  cents or  cents on each dollar of float they now take in only  cents or  cents
138 || 23 || some insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid alternative investments promising higher yields
138 || 24 || but those are dangerous games and activities that most institutions are ill-equipped to play
138 || 25 || berkshires situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general
138 || 26 || most important our unrivaled mountain of capital abundance of cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more investment flexibility than is generally available to other companies in the industry
138 || 27 || the many choices open to us are always advantageous  and sometimes have presented us with major opportunities
138 || 28 || our pc companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record
138 || 29 || berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for  of the last  years the exceptions being  and 
138 || 30 || in  our pre-tax loss was a whopping  billion
138 || 31 || in  the loss was minimal
138 || 32 || for the entire -year span our pre-tax gain totaled  billion
138 || 33 || that record is no accident disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers who know that the rewards of float can be drowned by poor underwriting results
138 || 34 || all insurers give that message lip service
138 || 35 || at berkshire it is a religion old testament styleas i have repeatedly done in the past i will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a sure thing danger always lurks
138 || 36 || mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years  even decades  to surface and ripen
138 || 37 || think asbestos a major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes katrina and ian will occur  perhaps tomorrow perhaps many decades from now
138 || 38 || the big one may come from a traditional source such as wind or earthquake or it may be a total surprise involving say a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate
138 || 39 || when such a mega-catastrophe strikes berkshire will get its share of the losses and they will be big  very big
138 || 40 || unlike many other insurers however handling the loss will not come close to straining our resources and we will be eager to add to our business the next day
