19 || 1 || ibm security systems strategy as the world becomes more digitized and interconnected the door to emerging threats is getting wider and security challenges are increasing in number and scope
19 || 2 || in order to keep pace organizations need to embrace a more systematic and proactive approach to addressing security and compliance requirements in todays information-driven economy
19 || 3 || the ibm security systems vision is to help customers evolve from a basic security model focused on perimeter protection to more sophisticated levels of security rigor and automation required for protecting todays rapidly changing it environments  to move into an era of security intelligence
19 || 4 || evolving from basic to proficient and finally to optimized security represents a shift from manual approaches to the use of increasingly automated and proactive processes for identifying tracking and addressing threats
19 || 5 || each of these levels adds a layer of preparation against both inadvertent and deliberate security incidents
19 || 6 || to help ensure that all aspects of security are properly addressed ibm created the ibm security framework
19 || 7 || based on industry standards the framework details six key security domains that need to be examined for potential risk elements and impact
19 || 8 || within these domains it is critical for the organization to define and manage the maximum level of acceptable risk
19 || 9 || these dimensions can be extended to challenges in emerging areas such as cloud and mobile security
19 || 10 || the ibm security maturity model shows the controls involved in the progression from basic to optimized security within each domain
19 || 11 || by deploying intelligent controls across these domains and distilling large volumes of security data into a small number of high-priority events we believe clients can understand more about the threats facing their organization be more effective in reducing risk and significantly reduce costs our strategy combines ibms innovative technology advanced research unique business insights and global reach to achieve a critical security goal  helping clients move from siloed point products to more integrated solutions
19 || 12 || ibms security strategy delivers intelligence integration and expertise across this comprehensive security framework
19 || 13 || ibm is helping customers  detect predict and remediate sophisticated threats with real-time protection correlation and analytics  improve visibility collapse silos and reduce costs with integrations spanning security data research and products  accelerate security initiatives with the help of expert research development and delivery resources across the globe ibm security maturity model ibm has developed a leading portfolio of security products and services spanning advanced fraud protection people data applications and infrastructure
19 || 14 || we also draw upon our success in business analytics software to help develop advanced analysis trends and patterns for security
19 || 15 || our strategy is to leverage these broad capabilities drive security into core processes and assemble a complete view of an organizations overall security posture
20 || 1 || security intelligence and analytics - internet-based threats and fraud continue to proliferate in todays complex networks
20 || 2 || compounding this problem is a steady rise in insider theft of valuable corporate information
20 || 3 || organizations must be able to consolidate siloed information to more effectively detect and defend against complex threats
20 || 4 || security-related information should be normalized correlated and analyzed to quickly deliver intelligence that allows organizations to detect notify and respond to threats missed by other solutions with isolated visibility
20 || 5 ||  qradar siem - provide full visibility and actionable insight to protect assets from a range of advanced threats while meeting critical compliance mandates  qradar log manager - collect archive analyze and report on network and security event logs across a distributed network  qradar risk manager - identify and reduce enterprise risks before an attack occurs  qradar qflow and vflow collectors - deep packet inspection and application analysis for physical virtual and cloud environments  qradar vulnerability manager - proactively discovers network device and application security vulnerabilities adds context and supports the prioritization of remediation and mitigation activities identity and access management - businesses need to make sure people across their organization and supply chain have access to the data and tools that they need when they need it while blocking those who do not need or should not have access
20 || 6 || key business challenges include the ability to effectively manage the on-boarding and off-boarding of dynamic work forces as well as the need to improve secure collaboration among customers suppliers and business partners
20 || 7 ||  ibm security identity manager - automate the creation modification and termination of users throughout the entire lifecycle with the ability to control identities through role management and auditing  ibm security access manager family - automate sign-on and authentication to enterprise web applications and services and provide entitlement management for fine-grained access enforcement  ibm security privileged identity manager - delivers a single solution designed to secure automate and audit the use of privileged identities helping thwart insider threats with privileged user provisioning strong password management and privileged user activity logging including the option of recording sessions  ibm security zsecure suite - user friendly layer over racf to improve administration and reporting with the ability to monitor audit and report on security events and exposures on mainframes data security - effective information security starts with a risk management approach that balances risks and rewards against availability and confidentiality of data
20 || 8 || organizations need to support widespread collaboration while protecting their critical data - whether its in transit or at rest
20 || 9 || they need to understand where their critical data lives and have methodologies in place to manage processes associated with classifying prioritizing and protecting data
20 || 10 ||  infosphere guardium product family - database monitoring vulnerability assessment data redaction access control and reporting to help ensure compliance
20 || 11 || control access to data written to file systems and databases and protect sensitive data from unintentional disclosure  infosphere optim data masking - obfuscate confidential data to prevent leakage  ibm key lifecycle management - centralize and automate the encryption key management process application security - enterprises need to preemptively and proactively protect their business-critical applications and processes from external and internal threats throughout their entire life cycle - from design to implementation and production
20 || 12 || this typically requires a combination of capabilities such as centralized authentication access and audit policy management web-application vulnerability scanning and threat prevention

20 || 14 || effective threat and vulnerability management also needs to be proactive rather than reactive preventing problems rather than responding to them
20 || 15 || to be efficient and effective businesses need to address prevention detection and compliance in a more integrated way
