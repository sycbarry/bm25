4 || 1 || the business value of ibm maximo through a series of in-depth customer interviews and a methodology for determining business value idcs analysis found that interviewed companies realized average annual benefits of  million per organization from ibm maximo by improving asset management avoiding unnecessary operational costs and increasing  overall eam efficiency improving the productivity of asset management and field workforce teams using  best available technology enabling the shift from legacymanual processes to more streamlined operations  via automation and other features supporting business needs by minimizing unplanned downtime and avoiding  disruptive events and asset failure while improving end-user productivity and contributing to better business results supporting business transformation from scheduled maintenance to condition-based  maintenance to predictive maintenance situation overview idc has been tracking the evolution of asset management for over  years
4 || 2 || what has been consistent is that organizations that have been leaders in investing in innovation and digital technology have also been leaders in various asset management performance metrics
4 || 3 || in idcs  worldwide future of operations survey we found that  of organizations in asset-intensive industries have continued to see improvements in productivity reliability and cost reduction
4 || 4 || they are also seeing improvements in safety energy management and sustainability
4 || 5 || continuous improvement is alive and well but the benefits are not evenly spread
4 || 6 || those that report being leaders in the adoption of digital technology were almost twice as likely to report performance improvements in reliability and productivity over the past two years as their peers
4 || 7 || similarly those that report better access and availability of data were also much more likely to experience performance improvements
4 || 8 || this data should put to bed any remaining skepticism of the central role of digital technology and data in driving continuous improvement
4 || 9 || and for asset-intensive industries the foundation for the use of digital technology and data is their eam system
4 || 10 || eam needs to evolve however
4 || 11 || in recent years idc has focused much of its research on cloud-enabled eam and not all vendors have made the transition smoothly see idc marketscape worldwide saas and cloud-enabled asset-intensive eam applications  vendor assessment idc us november 
4 || 12 || this is another area where the data from idcs worldwide future of operations survey is constructive
4 || 13 || specifically as it relates to the question of reliability of equipmentoperations those that have an enterprisewide strategy of putting more data in the cloud were  more likely to report positive performance improvements than those that do not allow data to be put in the cloud
4 || 14 || this lines up with anecdotal evidence from idcs clients and leaders in the area of cloud-enabled eam

5 || 1 || the business value of ibm maximo in summary the evidence clearly points to the need to continue to invest in digital technology and data to support continuous improvement in asset management
5 || 2 || it also points to the need for eam to evolve and adapt with the latest digital technology innovations such as cloud and aiml
5 || 3 || those organizations that recognize the need to make the necessary digital technology investments and partner with a solution provider which is itself investing in innovation will see a substantial return on their investments
5 || 4 || indeed digital technology and data allow asset-intensive organizations to see higher levels of reliability safety and sustainability while also reducing costs
5 || 5 || the traditional trade-off between reliability improvements and maintenance costs is fast disappearing for leading organizations which use cloud-enabled asset management to improve visibility predictability and decision making

17 || 6 || in particular investments in cloud platforms and aiml have led to an explosion of new capabilities for application vendors and end users to exploit
17 || 7 || the challenge for both is to find cost-effective ways to leverage these new capabilities while avoiding unnecessary disruption to the day-to-day imperative of managing assets and infrastructure
17 || 8 || ibm maximos investments in ai cloud and other digital technology innovations have been substantial but the market in these areas is increasingly noisy and crowded
17 || 9 || many of the new entrants have little or no experience in asset management or for that matter in the world of asset-intensive operations
17 || 10 || however it is not always the best solution that gets buyers attention but its the one that makes boldest promises or is perceived as being able to do something others have not been able to do

18 || 1 || the business value of ibm maximo another significant challenge is the diverse set of attitudes and approaches to putting applications and data in the cloud
18 || 2 || according to idcs  worldwide future of operations survey only  of organizations have an enterprisewide strategy of putting operational data in the cloud even as the value of doing so is becoming clear
18 || 3 || most of ibms existing maximo clients are using maximo on premises and to them the value of moving to the cloud will not be obvious
18 || 4 || while not an imperative the mutual benefit of doing so is becoming increasingly apparent
18 || 5 || asset management is foundational for every organization in asset-intensive industries as the organizations strive to improve operational performance and resilience
18 || 6 || the ultimate goal is to make the performance of all mission-critical assets transparent and predictable
18 || 7 || the ibm maximo suite is well positioned to deliver on this promise but it will require ongoing investments in innovation and an ability to take its existing customers on the journey necessary to get there
18 || 8 || this is the unavoidable challenge that market leaders face in every digital technology arena and the world of asset management despite its conservative nature is not immune to being disrupted
18 || 9 || conclusion the forces of digital transformation sweeping the global economy have mostly left asset-intensive industries and organizations relatively unscathed  until now
18 || 10 || it has become increasingly evident in the past few years that success or failure in these sectors is also heavily dependent on making the right digital technology investments
18 || 11 || more specifically the current phase of continuous improvement is tightly tied to the ability of organizations to use more and better data to ensure that the right decisions are being made at the right time
18 || 12 || excellence in asset management itself requires nothing less than the adoption of a full complement of digital technology solutions and capabilities including both eam and apm
18 || 13 || the ibm maximo application suite is one of the most comprehensive and widely adopted asset management solution sets on the market and as this study demonstrates it has delivered substantial benefits  including improved reliability reduced maintenance costs and higher levels of productivity  to its customers

19 || 8 || investments go beyond the initial and annual costs of using ibm maximo and can include additional costs related to migrations planning consulting and staff or user training
19 || 10 || calculated the roi and payback period
19 || 11 || idc conducted a depreciated cash flow analysis of the benefits and investments for the organizations use of ibm maximo over a five-year period
19 || 12 || roi is the ratio of the net present value npv and the discounted investment
19 || 13 || the payback period is the point at which cumulative benefits equal the initial investment
19 || 14 || idc bases the payback period and roi calculations on a number of assumptions which are summarized as follows time values are multiplied by burdened salary salary   for benefits and overhead to  quantify efficiency and manager productivity savings
19 || 15 || for purposes of this analysis based on the geographic locations of the interviewed organizations idc has used assumptions of an average fully loaded salary of  per year for it staff members and an average fully loaded salary of  per year for non-it staff members
19 || 16 || idc assumes that employees work  hours per year  weeks x  hours
19 || 17 || the net present value of the five-year savings is calculated by subtracting the amount that  would have been realized by investing the original sum in an instrument yielding a  return to allow for the missed opportunity cost
19 || 18 || this accounts for both the assumed cost of money and the assumed rate of return
19 || 19 || because it solutions require a deployment period the full benefits of the solution are  not available during deployment
19 || 20 || to capture this reality idc prorates the benefits on a monthly basis and then subtracts the deployment time from the first-year savings
